      "The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is a traditional practice that showcases the preparation and serving of coffee. As Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, this ceremony holds deep cultural significance.",
      "The ceremony begins with the washing of green coffee beans before they are roasted in a flat pan over hot coals. The aromatic smoke is often wafted around the room for participants to appreciate. After roasting, the beans are ground using a traditional wooden mortar and pestle.",
      "The ground coffee is then brewed in a special clay pot called a jebena. Once ready, the coffee is served in small cups without handles called cini, usually with sugar and sometimes salt or butter in certain regions. The ceremony is typically performed three times, with each serving named Abol, Tona, and Baraka.",
      "More than just a method of preparing coffee, the ceremony is a social ritual that brings people together. It's a time for conversation, community building, and showing hospitality to guests. In Jimma, where coffee cultivation is central to the local economy, the ceremony remains an essential part of daily life."
